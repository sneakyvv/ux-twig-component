    Even I can access the id from Generic Element as well: {{ id }}.
    Even I can access the properties from DivComponent as well: {{ divComponentName }}.
    Even I can access the properties from DivComponentWrapper as well: {{ divComponentWrapperName }}.
    Even I can access the functions of DivComponent via this.parent: {{ this.parent.someFunction }}.
    Since we are nesting two levels deep, calls to this.parent.parent will be {{ this.parent.parent.someFunction }}.
