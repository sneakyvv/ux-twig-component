{% set name = 'Fabien' %}

<twig:DivComponent>Hello {{ name }}!</twig:DivComponent>

<twig:DivComponent/>

<twig:DivComponentWrapper/>

<twig:DivComponentWrapper>
    And pass the content along and along and along.
    Btw even I can access the final block's context. I know that the id is {{ id }} as well!
    And of course since DivComponentWrapper's content is rendered inside of a DivComponent element, I also know DivComponent's properties. Its name is {{ divComponentName }}!

    Apart from the obvious access to DivComponentWrapper's properties, like its property "name": {{ divComponentWrapperName }}.

    The less obvious thing is that even at this level "this" refers to the component where the content block is used, i.e. the Generic Element.
    Therefore, functions through this will be {{ this.someFunction }}.
</twig:DivComponentWrapper>
