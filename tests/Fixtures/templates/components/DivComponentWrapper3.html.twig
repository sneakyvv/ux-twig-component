<twig:DivComponent5>
    I can access the id from Generic Element as well: {{ id }}.
    I can access the properties from DivComponent as well: {{ divComponentName }}.
    And of course the properties from DivComponentWrapper: {{ divComponentWrapperName }}.
    The less obvious thing is that at this level "this" refers to the component where the content block is used, i.e. the Generic Element.
    Therefore, functions through this will be {{ this.someFunction }}.
    Calls to this.parent will be {{ this.parent.someFunction }}.
    {{ block(outerBlocks.content) }}
